# Math Score Predictor

A simple ML project focused on demonstrating **modular architecture**, **CI/CD**, **Docker deployment**, and **cloud-readiness (AWS/Azure)** using a basic math score prediction model.

---

## Project Overview

This is a simple math score prediction model built with a small dataset (1000 rows, 4‚Äì5 columns). While the machine learning model itself is basic, the primary focus of this project is to demonstrate:

- Industry-standard project directory structure  
- Modular programming practices  
- Production-grade deployment pipelines  
- Cloud deployment capabilities (Azure, AWS)  
- Containerization with Docker  

---

## Key Features

- **Modular Code Architecture**  
- **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**  
- **Cloud Deployment Ready**  
- **Containerized with Docker**  
- **Production-grade Structure**

---

## Important Note

While this project uses a simple math score prediction model with a small dataset, its real value lies in demonstrating:

1. Industry-standard practices in project organization  
2. Production-ready deployment pipelines  
3. Modular programming approach  
4. Cloud compatibility with major providers
